	\section{The program Build}
	\subsection{Programming paradigms}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Manual programming
		\item Linear programming
		\item Structured programming
		\item Modular programming
		\item Object oriented programming
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Programming stages of Java}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Source code
		\item Java compiler
		\item Byte code
		\item Java virtual machine
		\item Executable
		\item Interpreter
	\end{itemize}
	Meaning write once, run anywhere.
	\subsection{The acronims}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item JavaC := Java Compiler
		\item JVM := Java Virtual Machine
		\item WORA := Write Once, Run Anywhere
		\item JIT := Just In Time
		\item JDK := Java Developer Kit
			\begin{itemize}
				\item JDK = JRE + JavaLang + JavaTools
				\item JavaTools = JavaC + Debugger + APIs
			\end{itemize}
		\item JRE := Java Runtime Environment
			\begin{itemize}
				\item JRE = JVM + libs
				\item JVM = Loader + Verifier + Interpreter + MemManag + JIT
				\item libs = APIs
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\section{The source code anatomy}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Packages are written all in lowercase.
		\item Classes are written as CamelCase with all first letters capitalized.
		\item Attributes are written as camelCase with all first letters capitalized, except the first.
		\item Variables are written as camelCase with all first letters capitalized, except the first.
		\item Method are written as camelCase with all first letters capitalized, except the first.
